                <p>Described as an "urban open-world RPG" and originally titled, Project Mugen, Ananta can be summed up as a mix of Genshin Impact, Persona, Spider-Man, and Grand Theft Auto. If that sounds like an eclectic mix of big-budget titles, you'd be right. Not only is NetEase looking to build an immersive open-world game, there is a lot more going on under the hood that sets Ananta apart from its various influences. If you can't wait to hit those mean streets, we've got all the latest news surrounding the Ananta release date.</p>
